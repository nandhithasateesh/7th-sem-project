## 🎨 Visual Verification

### Message Styling Guide
- **Room Creation** 🎉: Green background (`bg-green-500/20 text-green-400`)
- **User Join** ✅: Emerald background (`bg-emerald-500/20 text-emerald-400`)

### Message Positioning
- All system messages appear centered in the chat
- Messages have rounded corners and borders
- Font is semi-bold and slightly smaller than regular messages
- Messages include appropriate emoji icons

## 🔧 Technical Verification

### Server-Side Checks
1. Check server console for proper logging:
   - `[SECURE-CREATE] Room created successfully`
   - `[SECURE-JOIN SUCCESS] User joined room`
   - `[LEAVE] User left room`

### Client-Side Checks
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check console for socket events:
   - `message:new` events for system messages
   - `user:joined` and `user:left` events
3. Verify no duplicate messages appear

### Database/Storage Checks
1. System messages are properly stored in secure room message history
2. Messages include correct flags (`isRoomCreation`, `isUserJoin`, etc.)
3. Messages persist until room is deleted

## 🚨 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Duplicate Messages
**Symptom:** Same notification appears multiple times
**Solution:** Check that client-side join/leave handlers are properly updated for secure mode

### Issue: Missing Styling
**Symptom:** System messages appear with default gray styling
**Solution:** Verify message flags are preserved in `addMessage` function

### Issue: Messages Not Appearing
**Symptom:** No notifications show up in chat
**Solution:** 
1. Check server console for errors
2. Verify socket connections are established
3. Check that `addMessage` is being called correctly

### Issue: Wrong Message Content
**Symptom:** Messages show incorrect usernames or room IDs
**Solution:** Verify socket.username and room data are correctly set
